# sgs (static graph sites)

This is a very alpha version of a static site generator that uses an entry node in a graph (your index.html file) to discover other nodes to compile into static pages. Adjacent nodes are referred to via HTML attributes and JavaScript that sgs can run inline with your nodes/pages.

It is currently being used to generate [https://erdaniels.com](https://erdaniels.com)

More documentation to come but the source of [https://github.com/edaniels/erdanielsdotcom](https://github.com/edaniels/erdanielsdotcom) can be used to derive a new site for now.
